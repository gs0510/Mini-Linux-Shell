# Mini-Linux-Shell
Developed a basic Linux shell capable of handing keyboard interrupts, foreground and background process(start, pause, resume, listing of bg process). This project was developed using system calls in C.

A process can be sent to background using "Ctrl-Z". A process can also be sent to background using "stop <pid>" command. The command "start <pid>" will bring the process to foreground. The rest of the commands would execute as they do in a linux shell.
